# Sliding tree

## Task

Create an expandable tree.

Requirements: 

- Use delegation.
- Clicking on the headline should hide or show elements (as in the screenshots).
- Clicking outside the title text (in an empty place) should do nothing.
- When you hover the title - it becomes bold, implemented through CSS.
